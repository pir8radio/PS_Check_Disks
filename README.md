# PS_Check_Disks
A powershell script that checks all physical drives to make sure they are healthy and "ok", if not send a webhook to instatus.com.
Great way to monitor windows storage spaces/pools for a drive failure.

You can edit the payload and webhook url to post to Discord or whatever if you don't use instatus.com status page.
